# LRU_Cash
A template class that implements the operation of the LRU cache.
Implemented in the C++20 standard.

One of the most common uses of the LRU cache is to speed up access to frequently requested data, for example:

* Caching DNS requests (to avoid making repeated network requests).
* Caching of website pages (to speed up loading).
* Image caching (in browsers or mobile apps).
* Caching the results of complex calculations (for example, in data processing).
